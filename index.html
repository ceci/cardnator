			<h2>Can we borrow any technical debts for leverage, and pay it later?</h2>
		</section>
		<section class="explanation">
			<h2>Are there <a target="_blank" href="https://www.pipartners.com/technical-debt/">technical debts</a> you can use as leverage for earlier delivery, and pay later?</h2>
			<h3>Why does it matters</h3>
			</br>
			<p>Ignoring technical debt leads to long-term disadvantages that put the business – and value creation plans – at risk.</p>
			<h3>What to do</h3>
			<p>When technical debts are identified, it is important to classify and document them. We suggest the classification of debts according to the following classifications:</p>

			<ol>
				<li>Makes the activity unfeasible?</li>
				<li>It brings operational risk to the business?</li>
				<li>It happens with a certain frequency, but it is mapped?</li>
				<li>It can happen, but we have no previous evidence?</li>
			</ol>

			<p>We suggest that the items classified 1 and 2 be evaluated with greater criteria and have the risks mitigated and/or the task replanned. The items 3 and 4, have the green light to move forward, but always remember to document them.</p>

			<h4>Ask yourself...</h4>
			<h2>Are there parts of the card that are "must have", "should have", "could have" or "would like"?</h2>

			<h2>Are there parts of the card that are "must have", "should have", "could have" or "would like"?</h2>

			<h3>Why does it matters</h3>
			<p>All requirements are important, however, to deliver the greatest and most immediate business benefits early the requirements must be prioritized.</p>

			<ul>
				<li><strong>Must have:</strong> critical to the current delivery timebox in order for it to be a success. MUST also be considered an backronym for the Minimum Usable Subset.</li>
				<li><strong>Should have:</strong> important but not necessary for delivery in the current delivery timebox.</li>
				<li><strong>Could have:</strong> desirable but not necessary and could improve the user experience or customer satisfaction for a little development cost. These will typically be included if time and resources permit.</li>
				<li><strong>Would like:</strong> items that have been agreed by stakeholders as the least-critical, lowest-payback items, or not appropriate at that time.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>What to do</h3>
			<p>Keep the parts that that are Must and Should haves in this epic, and create smaller ones for could haves, and other ones for "Would likes".</p>

			<h4>Ask yourself...</h4>
			<h2>Are there more than one user case?</h2>
		</section>
		<section class="explanation">
			<h2>Are there different parts of this card that are "Must Have", "Should Have", "Could Have" or "Nice to Have"?</h2>

			<h3>Why does it matters</h3>
			<p>Use Cases are used to define and delimit the epic's scope once we try to get the user's point of view to set the requirements and achieve the impact. If we didn't, we could create epics with many scopes, and it will impact the complexity and deadline.</p>

			<h3>What to do</h3>
			<p>We suggest epics with one user case, that is, we need to answer just one issue using the user point of view.</p>
